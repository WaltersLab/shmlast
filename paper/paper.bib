	abstract = {The main way of analyzing biological sequences is by comparing and aligning them to each other. It remains difficult, however, to compare modern multi-billionbase DNA data sets. The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se. To solve this problem, we modified the standard seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds. Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large sequences with arbitrarily nonuniform composition.},

	abstract = {A new approach to rapid sequence comparison, basic local alignment search tool (BLAST), directly approximates alignments that optimize a measure of local similarity, the maximal segment pair (MSP) score. Recent mathematical results on the stochastic properties of MSP scores allow an analysis of the performance of this method as well as the statistical significance of alignments it generates. The basic algorithm is simple and robust; it can be implemented in a number of ways and applied in a variety of contexts including straightforward DNA and protein sequence database searches, motif searches, gene identification searches, and in the analysis of multiple regions of similarity in long DNA sequences. In addition to its flexibility and tractability to mathematical analysis, BLAST is an order of magnitude faster than existing sequence comparison tools of comparable sensitivity.},

	abstract = {Author Summary   C 4  photosynthesis is one of the most successful and widespread examples of convergent evolution; the first C 4  plant evolved long after the extinction of the dinosaurs, yet C 4  species now account for ∼30\% of primary productivity on earth. Compared with ancestral C 3  photosynthesis, the C 4  pathway allows faster rates of growth, and thus international efforts have been mustered to introduce advantageous C 4  traits into important C 3  crops to increase their yield. However, the transition from C 3  to C 4  involves complex alterations to leaf anatomy and biochemistry. Despite these multiple changes, C 4  photosynthesis has evolved independently at least 60 times. Through DNA and RNA sequencing we are beginning define a catalog of genes associated with C 3  or C 4  photosynthesis. However, we know little about how these genes act co-ordinately to bring about the convergent C 4  phenotype. In this work we develop a new informatics framework to reveal that two independent lineages of C 4  plants have co-opted the same regulators of gene expression to generate the C 4  leaf. Our findings provide a new paradigm for investigating the genetics of convergent traits and the origin of convergent phenotypes. Moreover, they reveal significant new insight into the regulatory mechanisms governing the origins of C 4  photosynthesis.},
