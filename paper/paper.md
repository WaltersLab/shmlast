# Summary

Conditional Reciprocal Best Hits (CRBH) was originally described by Aubry et al.[@aubry_deep_2014] and
implemented in the [crb-blast](https://github.com/cboursnell/crb-blast) package. CRBH is a method
for finding orthologs between two sets of sequences which builds 
on the traditional Reciprocal Best Hits (RBH) method; it improves RBH by
finding an expect-value cutoff per alignment length, and then selecting non-reciprocal 
alignments which meet the minimum threshold.

Unfortunately, the original implementation uses the relatively slow NCBI BLAST+ 
[@altschul_basic_1990], and is implemented in Ruby, which requires users to leave 
the Python-dominated bioinformatics ecosystem. shmlast makes CRBH available to users in Python, while also greatly improving
performance by using the LAST aligner [@kielbasa_adaptive_2011] for initial homology searches.
Other improvements include outputting the list of cutoffs generated by its model along with a plot
of the decision boundary to aid in quality control, as well as using gnu-parallel [@tange_gnu_2011]
to parallelize execution across multiple cores or nodes in a cluster environment.
